# ADMEA
ADMEA (Abstract Dynamic Multi-tasking End-to-end Algorithm) is a ML (Machine Learning) agorithm, and is the basis for the AI (Artificial Intelligence) that is will be built over top of this algorithm.
***
* **A**bstract: Structure is not known and the programmer does not build it.  
* **D**ynamic: The structure is torn down and built up on the fly.  
* **M**ulti-tasking: An ML term for having multiple labels for a set of inputs. This is reference to  
	the fact that each Node is a set of lebels and inputs. So the entire system has multiple labels. Each label could feed into another Node or be shown.  
* **E**nd-to-end: Another ML term that means the system does multiple single systems strung together to form a larger system.
